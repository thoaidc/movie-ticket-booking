# System Architecture

## Overview
- Describe the purpose of the microservices system.
- Outline the main components and their responsibilities.

## System Components
- **Service A**: Brief description of its functionality and role.
- **Service B**: Brief description of its functionality and role.
- **API Gateway**: Explain its role in routing and managing requests.

## Communication
- Describe how services interact (e.g., REST APIs, message queues).
- Mention internal networking (e.g., Docker Compose service names).

## Data Flow
- Explain the flow of data between services and the gateway.
- Include any external dependencies (e.g., databases, third-party APIs).

## Diagram
- Reference a high-level architecture diagram (place in `docs/asset/`).

## Scalability & Fault Tolerance
- Briefly discuss how the system can scale or handle failures.
